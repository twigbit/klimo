Our figures are based on the year 2020, in which, according to the German Federal Environment Agency, we had an average of 11.6 tons (as of 2020) in Germany. Starting from 2020, we consequently need to manage a difference of 9.1 tons by 2030, which corresponds to a uniform reduction of 910 kg of CO₂ emissions per capita per year.",
  "climate_points_info_message_2": "For all challenges, we have calculated the annual CO₂ savings potential, i.e., the realized savings if you permanently integrate the behavioral changes into your daily life. If a challenge has a CO₂ savings potential of 91 kg per year, that would be 10% of the annual reduction target. Completing the challenge is therefore rewarded with 10 climate points. This means: The climate points of a challenge are approximately the percentage of your annual CO₂ savings target, where a single climate point corresponds to 9.1 kg of annual CO₂ savings.",
  "climate_points_info_message_3": "For challenges where there is no direct CO₂ saving, we have introduced an alternative points calculation. Investments in sustainable products and services are also rewarded: An investment of 50€ corresponds to 10 climate points, so 1 climate point is equivalent to 5€. For example, you receive four climate points for purchasing a power strip for 20€. For very large investments, such as buying a photovoltaic system for 7000€, the app awards 1 climate point for every 50€, to ensure balanced gamification. Time spent on sustainable activities also counts: You receive one climate point for every half hour of time spent. For example, a 2-hour bike ride earns you 4 climate points.",
